The release for version 4.0 of the
[ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) is almost
ready for prime-time, and although the
[betas](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/) have seen steady
releases during the development lifecycle, I just wanted to give a quick preview
of some of the cool features available to you!

Some of the cool features covered in this quick demo video include:

- Easy styling of available widgets.
- FeatureLayer from a _FeatureCollection-like_ source. Much easier to author
  than a FeatureCollection.
- New and improved Portal API and working with Portal items!
- Working with the _MapImageLayer_, formerly known as
  _ArcGISDynamicMapServiceLayer_, using definition expressions and sublayers!
- Lazy-load WebMaps until they are ready to be displayed!
- A bonus peek at a small enhancement that will prove useful in upcoming
  releases, _shhhh_...

This is by no means a complete list of new features in the 4.0 version of the
API, nor does it cover changes from the beta releases, but gives a quick look at
some cool stuff you'll be able to do.

Some upcoming features not discussed here:

- Improved _Map_, _View_, _LayerView_, and working with layers.
- Data-visualization techniques in both 2D and 3D!
- Updated Portal API!
- Simplified API and single argument constructors.
- Advanced 3D capabilities and working with _WebScenes_!
- _Much, much more_

Keep an eye out for the 4.0 release coming soon and I look forward to seeing
what cool apps developers will build!
