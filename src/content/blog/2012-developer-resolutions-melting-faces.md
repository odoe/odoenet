description: It's that time of year again, 2011 is coming to an end and I start
  wondering where the hell the time went. Looking back at my 2011 resolutions, I
  didn't get as much done as I would like, but I like to think I accomplished
  quite a bit. I've been doing a lot of Node.js experimenting and I've gotten
  pretty good at CoffeeScript. I'm a better Ruby dev today than I was a year
  ago. My Python skills are about the same, but I've gotten more familiar with
  Django. I've learned some more native mobile, but have not had a chance to use
  it in production yet. My design skills could still use some help.

It's that time of year again, 2011 is coming to an end and I start wondering
where the hell the time went. Looking back at my
[2011 resolutions](https://odoe.net/blog/?p=124), I didn't get as much done as I
would like, but I like to think I accomplished quite a bit. I've been doing a
lot of Node.js experimenting and I've gotten pretty good at CoffeeScript. I'm a
better Ruby dev today than I was a year ago. My Python skills are about the
same, but I've gotten more familiar with Django. I've learned some more native
mobile, but have not had a chance to use it in production yet. My design skills
could still use some help.

I plan on forming my goals as this
[post](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/ten-new-years-resolutions-every-web-developer-should-make/)
at tutsplus suggest. So, for 2012, I'm trying to focus my goals a bit more.

- **Node.js**. I'm really enjoying the stuff I've been doing so far and I look
  forward to really getting to use Node in production applications. Couple this
  with CoffeeScript, and expanding my C/C++ skills and I hope to really become
  proficient with Node.
- **Ruby**. This includes, Rails and Sinatra. I've gotten pretty good here, but
  I can be better.
- **Silverlight**. I know, wtf right? Well, I actually have some opportunities
  that require I at least get good with Silverlight. I figure this also help out
  with my WP7 skills. Not a huge goal for 2012, but at least the beginning of
  the year.
- **Mobile**. Still on the list. I have a couple of opportunities here, so will
  put some focus into this area.

I also plan to improve myself as a well rounded developer. I have
[Mastering Algorithms in C](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565924533/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1565924533),
and plan on finishing that up along with some more books like it. My degree is
not in computer science, but I don't want that to hold me back.

For kicks, I'm also going to be trying my hand at some Lisp. I have
[Land of Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593272812/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593272812)
sitting on my bookshelf unread, so what choice do I have right?

I'm still actively pursuing freelance work as well, and so far it looks like
I'll be starting 2012 off with some work under my belt. Looking forward to it.

These goals are tentative. Chances are, I'll get sidetracked by something that
piques my interests. For all I know, I could end up praising Prolog by the end
of 2012.
