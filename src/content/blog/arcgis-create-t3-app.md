## Building scalable apps

If you're building an app of any size today, and you're using React, you have
probably looked at using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Next is great, it's a
framework for React, and provides some great tooling like routes, and server
side rendering.

Another great piece of tech on the scene is [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), which lets
you write type safe APIs. I won't go into too much detail here, but it works
great with TypeScript!

Yet another useful tool out there is [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). To be
honest, I wasn't a huge fan of Tailwind for a long time, but really, it's a
great way to quickly build some good looking apps.

Suppose you want to use all these tools together. You could cobble your way
through some configuration, and setup... or, you could use
[create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/)! create-t3-app is one of my favorite new
tools for quickly getting an application up and going.

I know, it's like buzzword webdev bingo, but it is so much fun!

I put together a new series on Youtube showing how you can use create-t3-app
with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript!

## Summary

Give create-t3-app a try, and see how you can use it for your new projects
today! It's a great way to get started with a variety of web tools and build
some awesome apps!
