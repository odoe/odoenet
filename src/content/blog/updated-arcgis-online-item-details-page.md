The most
[recent update to the ArcGIS Online platform](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/tag/whats-new-june-2016/)
introduced some really great new features.

Are you a developer who hasn't really familiarized yourself with the Online
tooling? Go sign up for a free
[developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/), because Online is all about
learning the platform and that will help you to _improve your ArcGIS API for
JavaScript skillz!_

## Updates

One of the interesting updates was done in the
[Item Details Pages](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/05/26/introducing-a-new-experience-for-working-with-items-in-arcgis-online/).

The Item Details page is the frontline where you can edit, visualize and
configure your item for use in the platform.

With these new updates, it is no much easier to...

- Quickly add the layer to a Map or Scene
- Edit the attributes of your data without a Map
- Update the visualization of your data without creating a WebMap
- Control who has access and how much access

This makes it much easier for you to work with your data directly in the item
details without having to load everything into a WebMap and configure it there.

So take a look at this video for an overview of the Item Details Page!

It used to be that in order to update the visualization of a FeatureLayer, you
had to add it to a WebMap, update the visualization in the WebMap and then
export that item with it's updated visualization as a new item or just use the
visualization as part of the WebMap. This process has been greatly simplified,
it's so easy, _even I could do it!_

There were more updates done to AGO in the latest release, and I'l cover more of
those new features in the coming weeks!
