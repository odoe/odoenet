You may have an existing ArcGIS API 3 for JavaScript application that is running
smoothly and is widely used... but you would really like to take advantage of
those sweet
[WebScenes](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/webscene-slides/index.html)
in version 4.

But you can't do a full rewrite yet, or maybe you're waiting for some features
to land in version 4 before you do.

As developers, sometimes _we just need to do what we need to do_.

In this video, I'll show you how you can gut the ArcGIS API for JavaScript
innards and void your warranty (I kid, there's nothing to void) and load both
the 3x and 4x versions of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript inside the same
application!

The best part is, WebMaps are just part of the platform, so you can load your
WebMap in 3x and a 3D view in 4x and the world will be a happy place!

As your friend, I need to advise you that _yes_, this works. It actually works
better than you might expect. I've just never been a fan of loading two versions
of any library side-by-side.

But around here, we don't have to play by the rules. We're here to get shit done
and make awesome apps!

If that means we do a little _hax_ once in a while, _so be it!_

Be sure to _like, comment, and subscribe!_

Thanks!
