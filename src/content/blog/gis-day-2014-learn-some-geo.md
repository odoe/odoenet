  it's GIS Day! Now please hold back your excitement. If you are a GIS pro, you
  are probably lounging around the house enjoying your holiday off. I'll be
  hanging out at the LA County GIS Day event most of the day hoping that it's
  not too cold and that there is an unlimited supply of coffee. Jack Dangermond
  is doing a keynote which should be pretty cool.

It's that special holiday we all look forward to this time of year, it's
[GIS Day](http://www.gisday.com/)! Now please hold back your excitement. If you
are a GIS pro, you are probably lounging around the house enjoying your holiday
off. I'll be hanging out at the
[LA County GIS Day event](http://egis3.lacounty.gov/eGIS/gisday/) most of the
day hoping that it's not too cold and that there is an unlimited supply of
coffee. Jack Dangermond is doing a keynote which should be pretty cool.

So for this GIS Day, I thought I would share a few resources for learning
something Geo.

1. **[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)** OpenStreetMap is the
   community driven map. Check out the
   [wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) and
   [LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/) for more details and enjoy.

2. **[MapTime](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/)** MapTime has really taken
   off and they provide more resources than I possible could. Check them out and
   keep an eye open for a local meetup in your area. I hear rumors an Inland
   Empire one may be started soon, I look forward to it. If I can help, let me
   know. My time is tight, but I can do something.

3. **[Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)** What? An online developer
   training site? Other than the fact I'm a big advocate of GIS pros learning
   how to do some programming, Pluralsight has a
   [Google Maps API](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/google-maps-api-get-started)
   and
   [Mapbox](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/getting-started-mapbox-javascript)
   course that are worth checking out.

4. **[LocatePress](http://www.locatepress.com/books)** This small publisher
   packs a punch with titles focused on geo. I have them all except for the
   PyQGIS book at the moment. The
   [Geospatial Power Tools](http://www.locatepress.com/gpt) book is highly
   recommended.

5. **[ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/)** If you work at
   all in Esri tech, you owe it to yourself to sign up for a free developer
   account and poke around. You get 50 free ArcGIS Online credits to use, which
   is good for some light analysis testing.

6. **[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)** Mapbox is great for custom tiles and
   many more features. The JavaScript API is based on
   [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and they have some good
   [tutorials](https://www.mapbox.com/foundations/how-mapbox-works/). Check out
   [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) for some awesome tile
   customization fun.

7. **[CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) and
   [Map Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/)** CartoDB is awesome. They are a
   great resource for creating effective map visualizations. When you really dig
   into the API, it's pretty much PostGIS on the web.

8. **[Boundless](http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/opengeo-architecture/)**
   Boundless provides an all-in-one package of GeoServer, PostGIS and OpenLayers
   goodness. This is a great resource if you want to try some open-source
   full-stack development.

9. **[Get Lat+Lon](http://teczno.com/squares)** I keep this site bookmarked. How
   many times have you needed to get the lat/long of a location for your mapping
   needs and get it quickly. This has come in handy so many times.

10. **[ArcGIS Web Development](http://manning.com/rubalcava/?a_aid=rrubalcava)**
    Ok, ok. Shameless plug, but if you are getting into development web maps
    with ArcGIS or you want to learn, check out my book. It's geared towards
    beginners with a little extras thrown in. Manning has some other titles I
    would recommend.
    [PostGIS In Action](http://www.manning.com/obe2/?a_aid=rrubalcava) and
    [Geoprocessing with Python](http://www.manning.com/garrard/?a_aid=rrubalcava).
    And because it's GIS Day, you could save half off using code
    **dotd111914au**.

11. **[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)** It was pointed out to me I missed a
    star resource, which is QGIS. This is an open-source desktop GIS tool. It
    can hook into all kinds of databases and create some wonderful maps. It's
    pretty extensive and powerful, so look at the docs for more info and check
    out
    [Learning QGIS 2.0](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/learning-qgis-20)
    and [The Geospatial Desktop](http://www.locatepress.com/gsd).

This is by no means an exhaustive list off all things geo. If you have any other
recommendations, please share or forward them my way. As I mentioned, for a more
in-depth list of resources, check out the
[MapTime](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/) resources page.
