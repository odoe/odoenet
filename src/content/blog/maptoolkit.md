description: So I had an oops moment when apparently I navigated to my local git
  directory using all lowercase letters and pushed my commits this evening.
  Although the folder structure in my local repo and the folder structure when I
  pulled my repo from github were identical, the github page had a FlexMapTools
  and a flexmaptools folder, the lowercase folder having my newest commits. Not
  wanting to dig through my copy of Pragmatic Version Control using Git, I
  decided to just nuke the reop and start over. Since I was doing that, I
  decided to go ahead and change the name to something a bit more fitting.

So I had an oops moment when apparently I navigated to my local git directory
using all lowercase letters and pushed my commits this evening. Although the
folder structure in my local repo and the folder structure when I pulled my repo
from github were identical, the github page had a FlexMapTools and a
flexmaptools folder, the lowercase folder having my newest commits. Not wanting
to dig through my copy of
[Pragmatic Version Control using Git](http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git),
I decided to just nuke the reop and start over. Since I was doing that, I
decided to go ahead and change the name to something a bit more fitting.

Edit: Apparently there is already a [MapToolkit](http://maptoolkit.net/) product
that I didn't see in my previous searches. I'll change the repo back to
FlexMapTools tonight. My apologies to the MapToolkit folks.
