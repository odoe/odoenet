It's a problem that could be very simple or involve some complex planning and
objectives. The ArcGIS Routing API is designed to be able to handle these tasks
and make it very easy for you to use.

This video covers how to use the tools built into ArcGIS Online to perform
routing tasks on the map and save your results! You could take this one step
