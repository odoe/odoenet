This is a quick, I mean _quick_ intro to the
[esri-loader](https://github.com/esri/esri-loader).

I was shooting for 2 minutes, that turn to 5, ended up around 7.

The esri-loader is cool if you are building apps with other build tools like
Webpack or one of those cool new cli tools to scaffold your apps. A lot of
times, you can't use the AMD loader of the API directly, so the esri-loader is a
method you could use to get work done!

Enjoy!
