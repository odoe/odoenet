This video will quickly walk you through setting up how to use the
[ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.0beta3](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/)
with the [ember-cli](http://ember-cli.com/).

Using the [ember-cli-amd](https://github.com/esri/ember-cli-amd) addon is easy
to do and quickly integrate the ArcGIS JS API into your Ember applications.
