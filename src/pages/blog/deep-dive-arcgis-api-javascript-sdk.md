I cover a lot of information geared toward building real-world applications using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/). I'm really in the dirt when it comes to summarizing tips and tricks and providing great value to you.

The backbone to all that is in the [documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/index.html), which you should be familiar with as a reference to quickly find information while you build your applications.

In this video we dive right into the deep end and cover the new and improved documentation for the ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript and how to navigate around to make it work for you. There is a lot of information in the SDK, that's because the API has a lot of features and capabilities. The search capabilities of the SDK alone should be a great enhancement for all users of the API.

Don't forget to check out my book for an [Introduction to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.0](https://leanpub.com/arcgis-js-api-4).
