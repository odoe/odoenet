It's no secret that I am a fan of TypeScript.

But I don't use it for everything, I still write plenty of regular JavaScript, mostly in _ES-something-or-other_.

I am also a long time Vim user, but I've slowly been moving over to using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) quite a bit. Today I want to show you a workflow that isn't just useful for the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), but pretty much any JavaScript library you may want to use that provides TypeScript Declaration Files.

That is, you can let your IDE know that you have these typings installed and when you write your JavaScript code, you can get intellisense based on the typings.

_Pretty cool right?_

This video just goes over how you can do that and you get to watch me fumble through misspellings and writing some JavaScript just to see the kind of intellisense and code completion you can get from this workflow.
