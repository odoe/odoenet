I've been experimenting with ways to add small, focused, utility actions to my maps. This could be something like clicking on the map and doing a buffer analysis, or double-click and query some data, and so on, I think you get the idea. I've called these behaviors, I've seen them referred to as _Map Actions_ or _Feature Actions_ when they interact with FeatureLayers.

In this video, I'll just go over one way you can add an action to do some reverse geocoding on your map by simply holding down the mouse or your finger on a mobile device using the [ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

It's not earth shattering, but it is kinda cool. Plus, you can see how you might utilize the ViewModel of an out-of-the-box widget without having to use the widget itself, which is really neat!
