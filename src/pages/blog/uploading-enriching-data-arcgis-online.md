This video covers how you can upload data into your ArcGIS Online account and then use the built in GeoEnrichment tools to enhance your datasets to make them even more valuable.

The [ArcGIS GeoEnrichment](https://developers.arcgis.com/features/geo-enrichment/) tools give you the ability to combine demographic data with your own datasets. This allows you to enrich your data and explore it in new ways.

We'll cover how to simply upload a zip of a Shapefile, create a hosted FeatureService and then create a new FeatureService using GeoEnrichment. Then we can use the built-in [SmartMapping](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/smart-mapping) tools to explore how to visualize that data on your map and the options you have to be able to share that data!

Please enjoy and let me know if you have any questions!
