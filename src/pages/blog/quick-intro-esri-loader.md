This is a quick, I mean _quick_ intro to the [esri-loader](https://github.com/esri/esri-loader).

I was shooting for 2 minutes, that turn to 5, ended up around 7.

The esri-loader is cool if you are building apps with other build tools like Webpack or one of those cool new cli tools to scaffold your apps. A lot of times, you can't use the AMD loader of the API directly, so the esri-loader is a method you could use to get work done!

Enjoy!
