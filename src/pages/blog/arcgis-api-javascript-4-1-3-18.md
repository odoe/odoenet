This week saw not one, but two new releases of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

The [4.1 documentation is here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

The [3.18 documentation is here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/).

The 4.1 release includes some great [new features](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/release-notes/index.html) in the MapImageLayer, 3D scenes and custom Popup capabilities. There's even some foundation being laid with the ability to save WebScenes for more Portal integration with the JSAPI.

The 3.18 release is starting to [include features](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jshelp/whats_new.html) we've seen in the updated ArcGIS Online such as the new FeatureTable, which is incredibly powerful. The VectorTileLayer has had an overhaul and some improvements implemented.

The [Bower versions of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-js-api/tags) have also been updated for users that want to create custom local builds of their applications.
