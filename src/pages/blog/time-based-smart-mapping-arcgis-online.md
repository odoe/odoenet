The latest updates to ArcGIS Online introduced a great new Smart Mapping capability. The ability to [create visualizations based on time data](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/06/16/whats-new-in-smart-mapping-june-2016/).

The ability to explore your data based on temporal information is incredibly useful and adds a new way for users to be able to create enticing maps and tell whole new stories.

In the video below I do a quick review of some of the new Smart Mapping capabilities and go over some of the configuration settings for each one.

You can visualize by continuous timeline with color or age, or you can visualize the data by age, so you can focus on how old events are and even focus in on time periods of your data.

The new time based capabilities are still very young, so I look forward to seeing what users are able to accomplish with these new tools to create some great looking maps!
