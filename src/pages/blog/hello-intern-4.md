I've talked about using [Intern before](https://odoe.net/blog/using-intern-arcgis-api-javascript/) for testing your [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) applications.

Well, there is a new version of [Intern](https://theintern.io/) out now that I've been integrating into my development lately and it was officially released last week.

It simplifies some of the configuration for running tests and makes it much easier to run code coverage on my source TypeScript code than before.

Check out the video below!

PS - Sorry I haven't been posting lately, I am knee deep in preparing for the [Esri European DevSummit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-europe) next week and I simply have not had time to breathe, much less write any posts or make any videos! I look forward to seeing you all there!
