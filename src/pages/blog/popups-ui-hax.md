The recent videos have covered an array of topics!

## Popups

I've had some interests about working with Popups in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, so you can check out these videos!

The Popup is probably the most widely used widget in applications. It's the first point of entry to get details about data displayed on the map. So learning how to take advantage of the Popup and customize it to fit your needs is definitely a skill you will want to learn!

## UI

In the ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript, there is a whole new UI/widget experience for developers to have fun with. So I wanted to cover some of that cool stuff as well!

## Hax

I even cover some more core concepts of building apps with the ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript, along side some experimental hax stuff as well!

I'm still going strong, releasing a video a day this month! I'm not too concerned about weekends, but cut me some slack, _I hax on weekends_.
