So as of right now, [LeafletJs](http://leafletjs.com/) is at [1.0 beta1](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/releases), which for anyone that has been using Leaflet for a while, is a big deal. In all honesty, everyone already knew the current release was stable as-is, but to get to a 1.0 release, even in beta is a big deal. So in anticipation of that and with features in place, [Esri-leaflet](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/) is now at 1.0.

That's very cool and congratulations to the team that made it possible. And because the release train never stops, there is a [2.0 checklist](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/571) looking forward.

You can get more details on the 1.0 announcement and a peak at what's coming in 2.0 on the [wiki](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/wiki/Esri-Leaflet-1.0.0-Announcement).

This is exciting news and I know I'll be rolling up my sleeves soon to get my hands dirty with Leaflet and Esri-Leaflet. Maybe I can get a [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) rewrite... hmmm.
