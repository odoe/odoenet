It's that time of year, it's wet outside (in SoCal anyway), I'm blasting through material and slides and wondering what I'm doing.

I tend to over-commit, and I like to think I over-deliver. I have to admit, I kind of thrive on it. Presenting and sharing material. I think I do a decent job of it. I also think I can party like I'm still 25 though, so what do I know.

I went to the [Esri European DevSummit 2016](https://odoe.net/blog/esri-european-devsummit-2016/) in Berlin just a few months ago, and it was a blast. I think I'm past my flying issues, at least I was cool on my return flight, but I could have just been too tired to care. It was a lot of fun to present with some European brethren and to get to meet all the European developers that may not get to fly over for the Palm Springs DevSummit.

While I was there, I was like _hey, can I go to DC too?_

## DC DevSummit

First off we have the [Esri DC DevSummit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-dc) next week, following [FedGIS](http://www.esri.com/events/federal). It's a one day DevSummit with condensed material. To give you an idea of the schedule for presenters, _here's my schedule._

That lines up with other presenters for the day as well. As you can see, it's a marathon, which also means you have a full day to weave in and out of sessions as you please.

There's some great stuff at this DevSummit. I'll be talking about the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), I'll be talking about visualizations and [Arcade](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) as well as some [Portal REST bits](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/administer/linux/scripting-with-the-arcgis-rest-api.htm).

I've never been to the DC DevSummit. I've never been to Washington, DC. Other than Berlin, furthest east I've gone is St. Louis (_this Buds for you_). I'm looking forward to it.

If you're on the fence about it, I highly encourage you to check it out. I think [registration](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-dc/registration) is still open. There's a _Meet the Presenters_ social at the end of the day, so if you're there, please stop by, say hi, ask me questions. I'll do my best to answer what I can.

## Palm Springs DevSummit

So now that I'm doing the DC DevSummit, I have to qualify the other one as [_Palm Springs DevSummit_](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit). _That's next month_. I'm currently finishing my presentations for DC and starting my presentations for Palm Springs. I'll go full on with them when I get back from DC. Palm Springs is pretty much a full week, so we have more time to cover more tech. I think I'm doing about 2-3 sessions a day and I'll be spending the rest of my time in the Developer Island area where you can walk on through, ask your questions of the developers that work on the tech. Plan out your week accordingly, but don't fret, sessions repeat, we hook you up.

I also enjoy Palm Springs because it gives me a full week of face time with other developers. I've seen you folks do some pretty creative stuff, so share your cool stuff.

As we get closer to the Palm Springs DevSummit in March, I'll do another post on sessions and maybe some sneak peak at stuff I'm working on.

I don't have any info on the European DevSummit, but if they need me, _I'll be there_.

For now, I look forward to seeing all of you, in either DC or Palm Springs!
