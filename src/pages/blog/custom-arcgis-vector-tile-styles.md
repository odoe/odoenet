With the introduction of [Esri Vector Tile maps](http://www.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=30de8da907d240a0bccd5ad3ff25ef4a&focus=layers) and their use in both the [3.x](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) and [4.0beta](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/), more and more people are going to be creating applications that utilize them.

You can always copy a style file to your ArcGIS account and edit that style to create some interesting and sometimes _bright_ custom styles for these Vector Tiles!

Check out the video below for a quick intro on how to use this simple [Vector Tile style editor](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-vectortile-style-editor/)!
