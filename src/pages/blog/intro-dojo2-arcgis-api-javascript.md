Dojo 2 has been in the works for quite some time. It is finally at a stage where most of the packages are in either alpha or beta and can be tested.

You can find more information about the status of each Dojo 2 package [here](https://github.com/dojo/meta#status).

[SitePen](https://www.sitepen.com/) has put a lot of work into making Dojo2 stable and powerful for developers. _Dojo2 is all written in TypeScript_. SitePen has also been very active in the TypeScript community and providing feedback on features and capabilities. The [Definitive TypeScript Guide](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2013/12/31/definitive-guide-to-typescript/) is still a go-to reference for anyone working with the TypeScript. There is a neat [blog post here](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2015/06/01/multi-platform-distribution-with-typescript/) on multi-platform distribution with TypeScript.

In this video, I attempt to show you how you can use a couple of features from [dojo/core](https://github.com/dojo/core) to assist in your application development with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) which uses the current stable release of Dojo 1.
