I'm a framework fan. You know it, I know it, _I've come to accept this_.

It all started with Flex, and PureMVC, Swiz, Robotlegs and more. So many different ways to create awesome apps.

Recently, I've been having a lot of fun with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). You can find some great videos at [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/develop-web-apps-with-vue-js) on getting started with it. Vue has also released a [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to help scaffold apps and I'm really digging it.

In this video, I wanted to demonstrate how you can add the [ArcGIS API 4 for JS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) to a vue-cli app. I was able to utilize an awesome little utility called [esri-loader](https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-loader) to make it easier to integrate!

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/odoe/vue-jsapi4).

I hope you enjoy the video!

I'll be talking more about using frameworks with the JavaScript API at the [Esri DevSummit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit) in Palm Springs in a couple of weeks, so I highly encourage you to attend. _Not just for one session, there's plenty of good stuff to learn there._
