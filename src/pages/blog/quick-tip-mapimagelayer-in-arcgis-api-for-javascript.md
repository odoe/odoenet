The [MapImageLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-MapImageLayer.html) is a totally revamped version of the [ArcGISDynamicMapServiceLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jsapi/arcgisdynamicmapservicelayer-amd.html) in version 3 of the ArcGIS JS API.

The MapImageLayer API has been greatly simplified to work with [Sublayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-MapImageLayer.html#sublayers) that allows you to create [definitionExpressions](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-mapimagelayer-definitionexpression/index.html), [customize renderers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-mapimagelayer-renderers/index.html), work with [query tables](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-dynamicdatalayer-query-table/index.html) and more.

In this video we take a quick look at the MapImageLayer and how to work with a service with a large amount of layers and add a popup to one of your choosing.
