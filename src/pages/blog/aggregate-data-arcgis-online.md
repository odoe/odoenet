The ArcGIS Platform isn't just used for serving data and creating webmaps. _It can also be used as a tool to create and analyze data._

In this video, we cover how you can take an existing dataset of points, possibly collected in field data, and do some aggregation on that data. This is a popular way to perform some statistics on your data and is something that is easy to do in ArcGIS Online.

You can read more about the analysis tools in the [documentation](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/perform-analysis.htm).
