The [Accessor](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-core-Accessor.html) is a key compoment of the ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript. It allows you to do some really awesome stuff like [watch for property changes](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/working-with-props/index.html) in your application.

I've talked about [them before](https://odoe.net/blog/fun-with-accessors-in-arcgis-js-4beta1/) and how [useful they are](https://odoe.net/blog/arcgis-js-api-4-0beta1-accessors/).

Today, I just want to quickly look at how they can be used as a datastore for an application I [discussed before](https://odoe.net/blog/diy-redux-using-esrijs-4/). I just wanted to spend a little more time on the subject, as I think Accessor is a fantastic addition to an developers toolbox using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
