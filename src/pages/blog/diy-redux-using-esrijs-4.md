I'm a big fan of React. Mostly because it's focused one thing and that's on building components. It's up to me to decide how I want to use those components and wire them together.

One of the first architectures released for React apps was [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) and Flux is great for managing separation of updating state from the components. I actually prefer it sometimes to other methods.

Another popular one is [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). Now Redux isn't necessarily a _React-only_ architecture or library, but I'm sure that's how most people use it.

I wanted to see if I could use the latest [ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) to do some _handcrafted artisanal Redux architecting_. Or _poor-mans Redux._

This actually works out pretty well for building ArcGIS JS apps. This is of course, all experimental, but I think worth doing some more prototypes and testing to really flesh it out.
