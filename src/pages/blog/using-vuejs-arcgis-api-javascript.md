It's no secret that I am a fan of JavaScript frameworks.

One little framework I haven't touched in a long time is [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).

What I really like about VueJS is that it is a very simple to use JavaScript framework that provides a big benefit to developers that want a templating library without all the cruft. It can scale well and it also provides all the stuff that JavaScript developers are looking for, it has a [vdom](https://jbi.sh/what-is-virtual-dom/) and it provides easy to update bindings and it's own [custom elements](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/custom-elements/) that can be reused.

In this quick demo, I show how you can create a custom element to display detailed information about the [Camera](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Camera.html) of a [SceneView](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-SceneView.html) in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
