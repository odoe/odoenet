I wanted to do something a little different today. I was reading a post somewhere about how can GIS developers showcase their portfolio as part of their job search. One thing that came to mind aside from some of the standard stuff like maintaining a github account, was to showcase Web Maps, Layers and more in your ArcGIS Online account.

I don't really talk a lot about how to actually manage your ArcGIS Online account and organization.

I've gone through and customized [organization page](https://odoenet.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) for my [developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/sign-up/).

Customizing your page isn't too difficult, and the [instructions in the documentation](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/configure-site.htm) provide a lot of really good details.

I think most developers should do some sort of customization to their ArcGIS Online home page to highlight some of their projects, link back to your github or LinkedIn profiles. You could even put your resume in here and share with potential employers. It would be a great way for you to market yourself.

It would be a great idea for you to prepare some interesting Web Maps and maybe different layer visualizations and even Story Maps that you can share on your ArcGIS Online home page as featured content.

In this video, I just quickly cover some of the options available to you in customizing and administering your ArcGIS Online page.
