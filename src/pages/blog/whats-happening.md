I like doing work that has me interacting with users and geodevs. It's fun, I get some great feedback, some _critical_ feedback, but that's cool. I really enjoy seeing what others are doing and I enjoy helping people solve their geodev problems.

I don't know what happened, but I filled up my plate pretty good for the next couple of months.

## GeoDev Webinar Series

The GeoDev team is kicking off a cool new [series of webinars next week](http://go.esri.com/geodev) with [Discovering the ArcGIS API 4.x for JavaScript.](http://go.esri.com/geodev-javascript-api)

I'm co-presenting this one with [Andy Gup](https://twitter.com/agup) and there's a lot of material to cover here in a short amount of time. Just look at the [description here](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/geodev/blog/2017/09/01/never-want-devsummit-to-end-keep-it-rollin-with-the-geodev-webinars). Andy and I have been hard at work here pulling in some basics that we think devs should know, but also some fun cool features and tips and tricks! I highly recommend you check this one out and register today!

## TechCrunch Hackathon

This is going to be my third [TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon](https://techcrunch.com/event-info/disrupt-sf-2017/disrupt-sf-2017-hackathon/) and this year it takes place Sept 16 and 17. I'll be down there with some other Esri geeks to help hackers out, answer questions and get the ball rolling to put their hacks together. This is always fun, because some of these crews put together some pretty impressive apps together in a short amount of time. These are long days too, hackers sleep there over night. I won't. But myself and others stay pretty late to help them out.

## Esri DevSummit Europe

I had a great time in Berlin last year at the [Esri European DevSummit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-europe) and I must have done something right, because _they're sending me back again this year_. It was my first time out of the country other than Mexico, and [I cut it really close with passport](https://odoe.net/blog/esri-european-devsummit-2016/). I'm working on some workshop stuff for this one and some presentations as well. I'm really looking forward to this one, it's a little bit of a different vibe, _awesome food_, and a great mix of people.

As far as I know, these are the big tasks I have over the next couple of months (_that I can talk about_). I'm sure there's more coming up. I'm excited about meeting other developers, answering questions, helping others learn, and overall helping others build awesome shit for their users.

Thanks for letting me do what I do.
