[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) is the de facto standard for sharing spatial data online. It's a neat format that keeps things simple. I think I've heard it called it **"...the [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) of the internet"**.

Like shapefiles, you can take this simple piece of data and you can upload into [ArcGIS Online](http://www.arcgis.com/features/) using your free [ArcGIS Developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/) and you can start leveraging the tools in ArGIS Online to really add some flare to that simple GeoJSON data.

Check out this video for a quick demo.
