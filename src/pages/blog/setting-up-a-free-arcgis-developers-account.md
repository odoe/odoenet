This week I'm going to cover how to quickly sign up for a free [ArcGIS Developers Account](https://developers.arcgis.com/) and also how you can create new FeatureServices as well as application level authentication for your apps.

When you sign up for a developers account, you get access to 50 credits per month to test-drive the ArcGIS platform.

If you need more credits or your developer account, you can [upgrade](https://developers.arcgis.com/plans/) to get more credits, but I've found as a developer, the 50 credits per month is usually enough.

I hear the question come up every now and then about _What can I do with 50 credits?_

Just so happens, there is a [page that describes exactly what 50 credits will give you](https://developers.arcgis.com/credits/).

Basically you only consume credits for analysis involving geocoding and directions, geonerichment and premium content like traffic maps and storage of your data. For a free developers account, that's an awful lot of features available to you to learn the platform and what you can do with it.

So enjoy this intro video on _Setting up a Free ArcGIS Developer Account!_
