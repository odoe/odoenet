This weekend is a holiday weekend in the states, but I want to say thank you to all my readers and everyone who has purchased any of my books, either [ArcGIS Web Development](https://www.manning.com/books/arcgis-web-development) or [Intro to ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript](https://leanpub.com/arcgis-js-api-4)!

To say thank you, I wanted to offer you a _**$5 off**_ my latest book this weekend only! That means you can get the book this weekend for the low price of **$9.99** on LeanPub. Don't forget LeanPub is a pay what you want system, with a current minimum of $14.99.

Notice the latest book has had a name change to reflect that it will be updated and maintained during the course of the ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript lifecycle. _What does that mean?_ It means that I'll keep updating the book as new updates to version 4 of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript are released. If you purchased it when version 4.0 came out, you'll get the udpates for when version 4.2 and further come out automatically.

I look forward to more offerings in the future on spatial technologies and _maybe even some stuff a little different._
