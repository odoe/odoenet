I was recently asked about setting up a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This was specifically in reference to using the [ArcGIS API 3 for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/).

I decided to make this video to help users get up and running with Visual Studio Code using TypeScript for their ArcGIS API for JavaScript applications.

This video doesn't need to be specific to the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, it can also be useful for using TypeScript in any project with Visual Studio Code.

You can find the source for the sample application [here](https://github.com/odoe/esrijs-ts-demo).
