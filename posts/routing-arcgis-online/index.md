One of the most basic features you may want to do with the ArcGIS Platform is [routing and directions](https://developers.arcgis.com/features/directions/). It's a problem that could be very simple or involve some complex planning and objectives. The ArcGIS Routing API is designed to be able to handle these tasks and make it very easy for you to use.

This video covers how to use the tools built into ArcGIS Online to perform routing tasks on the map and save your results! You could take this one step further and use the results to improve planning and time management.

Enjoy!
