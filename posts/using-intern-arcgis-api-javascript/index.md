[Intern](https://theintern.github.io/intern/) is a JavaScript testing framework maintained and developed by the folks at [SitePen](https://www.sitepen.com/) that also maintain the [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/).

It's a great framework that allows you to run unit tests, functional tests, as well as integrate with cloud-based browser testing like [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) or [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com/).

This video shows how the unit tests in the [sample app](https://github.com/odoe/gen4) for the [ArcGIS JS API generator](https://github.com/odoe/generator-arcgis-js-app) were written and how they work. It also covers how the [testdouble.js](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js) mocking library is used with the Intern tests.

We'll also talk a little bit about code coverage and how it can be a handy tool to help you write your tests.

So please enjoy this video!
