# Uses

## To get shit done

* I mainly use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for dev on my Linux system.
* My current Linux flavor is [Pop!_os](https://pop.system76.com/). I really only use Windows for playing games.
* Yes, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well, but mainly for screencasts.
* I use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) for my terminal, _meeeeow_.
* To kind of keep track of things I read, or tasks to do, I use [notion](https://www.notion.so/). It works fine for me.

## Streaming/Recording
* Like everyone else, I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). OBS is great, because it's not just for streaming, but great for recording videos and has a few nice features for live recording.
* I've settled on [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) for video editing. I'm still learning it, but it's been working great!
* For the times I need to tweak some audio files, I use [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

## Hardware
* My main machine runs on a [Ryzen 3900x](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SXMZLP9/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=odoenet-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=78be3480d84e8d666e867f357dff3da9&creativeASIN=B07SXMZLP9).
* Runs on an [Asus X570 TUF](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXF8GY3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07SXF8GY3&linkId=95831fd3f5b2d550bf1efa04f6f1c0da) with [32GB Corsair LPX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016ORTNI2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B016ORTNI2&linkId=dd5231f4cfcfd0a17486a6d192024ded)... could use a RAM upgrade.
* Video Card is an [MSI 20270 Super](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0856BVRFL/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0856BVRFL&linkId=8f8351a6f4b47665173b51c9cbe86798)... I'll find an AMD 6x or Nvidea 3x series eventually.
* Use a [LG 27GL850](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TD94TQF/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07TD94TQF&linkId=dd64b748977493116d71ce364401263a) for gaming and a 34" Acer Ultrawide similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZL57G3Z/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07ZL57G3Z&linkId=85761d9100ad86313fd2c0d9126a65f9) for writing code and video editing.
* Everything sits on this [FEZIBO Standing Desk](https://amzn.to/37PceFH), that I do stand at sometimes.

## Recording Gear
* I use a [Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N1YPXW2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00N1YPXW2&linkId=5b83490c7b49cb956c558786366efa51) mic.
* Mic sits on a [Heil PL-2T boom](https://amzn.to/37QFegn).
* A [Logitech C920](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085TFF7M1/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=odoenet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B085TFF7M1&linkId=476509bc566c5f5d96815cc30f1cecc8) as the webcam.
* Webcam even sits on a basic [webcam boom](https://amzn.to/2M2cxVi).
* I use these [Akai 50X](https://amzn.to/3mQsYkp) headphones while editing.
