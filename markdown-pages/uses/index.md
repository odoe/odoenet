# Uses

## To get shit done

* I mainly use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for dev on my Linux system.
* My current Linux flavor is [Pop!_os](https://pop.system76.com/). I really only use Windows for playing games.
* Yes, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well, but mainly for screencasts.
* I use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) for my terminal, _meeeeow_.
* To kind of keep track of things I read, or tasks to do, I use [notion](https://www.notion.so/). It works fine for me.

## Streaming/Recording
* Like everyone else, I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). OBS is great, because it's not just for streaming, but great for recording videos and has a few nice features for live recording.
* I've settled on [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) for video editing. I'm still learning it, but it's been working great!
* For the times I need to tweak some audio files, I use [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

## Hardware
* My main machine runs on a [Ryzen 3900x](https://amzn.to/3o1eGP5).
* Runs on an [Asus X570 TUF](https://amzn.to/38OzmDN) with [32GB Corsair LPX](https://amzn.to/2L60TIq)... could use a RAM upgrade.
* Video Card is an [MSI 20270 Super](https://amzn.to/3nZh4Wx)... I'll find an AMD 6x or Nvidea 3x series eventually.
* Rig is housed a [Fractal Design Meshify C](https://amzn.to/2KMTnTc).
* Use a [LG 27GL850](https://amzn.to/2L60XYG) for gaming and a 34" Acer Ultrawide similar to [this](https://amzn.to/3pDUbbT) for writing code and video editing.
* Everything sits on this [FEZIBO Standing Desk](https://amzn.to/37PceFH), that I do stand at sometimes.

## Recording Gear
* I use a [Blue Yeti](https://amzn.to/34WzO1s) mic.
* Mic sits on a [Heil PL-2T boom](https://amzn.to/37QFegn).
* A [Logitech C920](https://amzn.to/2L96f5G) as the webcam.
* Webcam even sits on a basic [webcam boom](https://amzn.to/2M2cxVi).
* I use these [Akai 50X](https://amzn.to/3mQsYkp) headphones while editing.
