The [Esri Developer Summit 2015](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit/agenda) kicks off this week. technically it starts tomorrow with the plenary, but there have been pre-summit training sessions since yesterday and tonight there are lightning talks.

I'll be doing a lightning talk tonight on **Leaflet Controls** if you want to see a quick five-minute rundown on how they work.

I'm also scheduled to do a presentation on [Enjoy some ES6 in your JS apps today!](https://geonet.esri.com/thread/118134) on Wednesday at 1:30pm in Mesquite C. There seems to be an _issue_ with the online agenda and I'm not listed, so _cross your fingers_ I'll be showing how I've been using ES6 features in my EsriJS apps recently.

I think I only missed the first year of the developer summit, so I've been going for a while and I learn something new every year. I really enjoy the user sessions as they provide great insight into what others are doing in the trenches.

I'll be at the lightning talks tonight and I could have sworn there was also a speedgeeking session tonight or tomorrow night, not sure, I think the online agenda is a little borked at the moment. I'll have a couple of copies of [ArcGIS Web Development](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1617291617/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_lc?tag=odoenet-20&camp=15309&creative=331441&linkCode=st1&creativeASIN=1617291617&adid=0YF9M7SEXBZ04VAGSK55&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fodoe.net%2Fblog%2F) with me tonight and throughout the week to give away as well.

Hope to see you all at the developer summit this week and for those of you at [FOSS4GNA](https://2015.foss4g-na.org/) I hope to see you all next year!
