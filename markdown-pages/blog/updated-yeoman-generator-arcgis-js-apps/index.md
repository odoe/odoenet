I finally had some time to work on updating the [Yeoman Generator for ArcGIS JS Apps](https://github.com/odoe/generator-arcgis-js-app).

I really wanted to add support for version 4.0 of the ArcGIS JS API and was able to do that as well as provide the ability to choose Stylus or Sass as the CSS preprocessor. I prefer Stylus, but a lot of libraries like Bootstrap and [Calcite](http://esri.github.io/calcite-web/) provide Sass, so it can be a good choice for some users.

View the video below to get a quick rundown of the updated generator and application!

You can view a demo of output application [here](https://github.com/odoe/gen4) and a live demo of the optimized application [here](https://odoe.net/apps/js4start/).

Give it a try and see if it helps you get up and running using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to build your applications!
