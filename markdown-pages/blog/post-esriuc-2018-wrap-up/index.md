Well, that was a heck of an EsriUC. You can see a lot of the action on the [@EsriUC twitter account](https://twitter.com/EsriUC).

UC is interesting, it's a mix of users, managers, analysts, techs, devs, people from other industries interested in how spatial can fit into their workflows. Whereas DevSummit is heavily focused on devs and _geogeekness_. It's fun to get to meet users that are brand new to spatial and even brand new to development or maybe new to JavaScript!

If you swung by the JavaScript island at the UC, you probably had the pleasure of talking to the folks that work directly on the [JSAPI](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), and hopefully got some great insight into and awesome answers.

I was only there a couple of days this year, but I had some people share some really cool stuff they were working on and _I think_ was able to answer some very specific questions. The team got some great feedback on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, some interesting use cases that we've taken to heart and are looking at what we can do to improve the API even further, which is fantastic for everyone. Like I say, _it's our goal to make you a badass at what you do_.

I had a great time seeing some familiar faces, people I used to work with, previous [mentors and teachers](https://twitter.com/RHCGIS), and had a great time meeting new users.

I did have the pleasure of presenting with [Kelly Hutchins](https://twitter.com/odoenet/status/1017856651058036736) on best practices for building apps. You can find the slides for this presentation [here](https://odoe.github.io/presentations/2018-UC/jsapi-best-practices/slides/#/). This was our first time doing this specific session, and I've got some ideas on how to tweak it for the next time around. Some good tips in here.

I also did a presentation on Optimizing your apps with [L-loyd Heberlie](https://twitter.com/lheberlie). This was a PPT, which will be available at a later time. But, you can check out the demo app I showed on [github](https://github.com/odoe/arcgis-pwa). We talked about the [webpack-plugin](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-webpack-plugin) and the [cli](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-js-cli).

I look forward to seeing everyone at the [2019 Esri DevSummit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit) and I think the [Esri European DevSummit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-europe)! Hack away!
