A while ago, I had started a book on the ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript and self-published it via [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/arcgis-js-api-4/).

I'm happy to say that the book was recently picked up by APress and is available [directly](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484232811) from them! By the way, **APress is running a 50% discount right now as well!**

You can also pick it up at [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2C6iCFS) and please leave a review!

Now if you already purchased the book from Leanpub, you should have an email from the last update of the book a few months ago, so don't worry about it!

The content and samples were updated for the latest release of the API. The main reason I went with a publisher on this one is to make print books available, as I had lots of requests for printed books, but the options I found would make the cost way more than I was comfortable with.

Thank you everyone for your support, this makes my second published book and again, it's just one of those things I never imagined I would do.

You can check out [my products page](https://odoe.net/blog/products/) to see my other training materials available from Packt publishing on [Using the ArcGIS Online Platform](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/using-arcgis-online-platform-video) and [Building Apps with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-arcgis-cross-platform-applications-javascript), both of which are very introductory. _PS, I hear there will be a Pack sale soon, I'll keep you posted_

I have some ideas of projects I want to work on next, one of which I hope to finish up by the beginning of the year and that one will be _free!_

Some other projects I'm looking to plan out might be a little different. Did you know that [geodev.io](geodev.io) redirects to my homepage? _hmmmm_

Thanks again everyone!
