_Say hello to Arcade._

It's been a while since I've made a video. I had a lot of work to do for the [DevSummit](https://odoe.net/blog/esri-european-devsummit-2016/) recently, but this week I decided to wait until the latest [ArcGIS Online release](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/12/14/whats-new-arcgis-online-december-2016/) because this release introduces a new platform expression language called [Arcade](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/)!

Arcade is kind of JavaScripty, Pythonic bit of a way to define expressions in your maps that can be understood in the entire platform.

It's useful for custom labels and for providing more flexibility in creating visualizations where you can use Arcade to extract more data from your features.

The following video is by no means a tutorial, but a quick intro into what you can do with Arcade in the MapViewer.
