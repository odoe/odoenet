I came across an interesting [GeoNet post](https://geonet.esri.com/thread/180187) the other day about getting the points from intersecting lines.

This is similar to problems I've come across in the past while working with ArcMap to create data from street intersections as well sewer-line connections to main sewer lines.

Normally this is the type of information you can get from having a [geometric network](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/geometric-networks/managing-a-geometric-network.htm), but sometimes you just need to have some basic data for intersecting lines that may not be part of a larger network.

This short video covers some of what the problem is in trying to find points from the intersection of lines as well as couple of solutions you may be able to use.
