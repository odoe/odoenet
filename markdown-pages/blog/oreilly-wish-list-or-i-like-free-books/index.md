[O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/store/index.html) is running a contest to give away $500 of books. I don't have $500 to spend on books, but I want books, so this is the best contest ever! If I win, I'll take Print/E-books please, my Kindle needs some sweet sweet loving.

[Learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596157135/) This is a classic combination of technology for web development. I don't know PHP, but I would love to put some time into learning it and how to use it with MySQL and JavaScript.

[Head First Python](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449382674/) Everyone loves Python. I know enough Python to get stuff done with my geoprocessing services using ESRI ArcPy. Becoming more of a Python expert is one of my goals for the year.

[Hadoop: The Definitive Guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449389734/) [Cassandra: The Definitive Guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449390419/) The above two titles I chose because I am fascinated by the idea of working with large amounts of data and being able to mine that data. I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to use something Hadoop or Cassandra in my work environment, but I would be more than happy to see if I could use these tools for GIS somehow.

[CouchDB: The Definitive Guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155902) [MongoDB: The Definitive Guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920001096/). These two titles are something I'm currently excited about, as I know MongoDB has spatial query capabilities, and I already have some ideas about how I might be able to use it with Python in caching Geoprocessing results.

[HTML5: Up and Running](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596806026/) I'm no HTML/CSS guru, but I'm about tools and if I can learn to use Canvas or other HTML5 tools to do some cool stuff, I'm all over it.

[Programming Android](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449302689/) [Developing Android Applications with Adobe AIR: Rough Cuts](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449394813/) [Programming iOS 4](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449302672/) Mobile development is part of my goals for this year, and these titles would be a big help in that goal.

[Algorithms in a Nutshell](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516246/) I wasn't a Computer Science student, so anything that can help me get a better grasp on algorithms, I would love to have.

So that's my O'Reilly wish list. It's a shot in the dark that I'll win, but hey, you never know. Free books are the greatest books ever!
