I'm trying something a little different recently.

For the month of August, I am shooting for one youtube video a day.

Yup, one video a day.

It's nuts, I know.

But I enjoy doing them, _maybe you'll enjoy watching them_. I'm also trying to keep them at 5 minutes and under as well. So you don't get tired of hearing me ramble.

If I want to cover a topic I think will be a bit more in-depth, I'll break it up into multiple videos so it's easier to digest.

So far this week, I have put up the following videos!

After the month of August is up, I'll probably go back to a weekly update, but I'll try to keep them short still.

There will still be regular non-video blog content starting next week, but I'm really enjoying the video format and I get to have some fun with it.

I have a list of topics I want to cover, but if there is anything you want me to talk about, just let me know, feel free to contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/odoenet) or leave message on this post or a youtube vid!

Thanks!
