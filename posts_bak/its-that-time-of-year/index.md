First of all, sorry.

It's been quiet around here, but for good reason.

_I got shit to do._

I know, that's no excuse. You should see how much work some of the others around here are doing. Now, they really _got shit to do._

First off, I did a lot of work recently to put together a new application for the [ArcGIS Example Apps page](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/). The application is a [Maps App JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/maps-app-javascript/) that showcases lots of really cool features. You can read more about it on this [Esri blog post](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2018/02/26/maps-app-javascript/).

If you are unaware, the [2018 Esri Developer Summit is next week!](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit/agenda)

There are slides to prepare, demos to finish! Practicing to do and much more!

There's a really cool blog post on the [Esri blog](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2018/02/21/web-development-session-guide-to-the-2018-developer-summit/) that lays out all the different JavaScript sessions and organizes them into different levels. I definitely recommend it to help you put your agenda together.

And yes, I'm mostly a web dev guy, but there is some cool ArcGIS Runtime stuff going on and there is a [page on that too](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2018/02/24/a-native-developers-guide-to-the-2018-developer-summit/)! I have an urge to up my Kotlin game!

Almost immediately after Dev Summit is over, a bunch of us are flying out to the debut of a new TypeScript conference, [TSConf](https://tsconf.io/)!

I'm really excited about this one. First off, it's the first TSConf, with a great lineup of speakers. Second, it's my first time in Seattle. I've historically not been a very good flyer, but I think I've improved greatly this past couple of years, so it should be a fun time and opportunity to learn a lot. I'll post a blog about when I get back!

The following week, I'll in Washingto DC for a day to present at [DevSummit DC](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-dc)! I went to this last year and it was definitely interesting. It's only one day, and a lot of information is condenssed. I'll be presenting all day, in every block, it's kind of a marathon! I dig it in a self-torture kind of way. Only downside is I'm not really available for questions much during the day, but I think there is an opportunity for attendees to ask us questions at the end of the day. I'm looking forward to it!
