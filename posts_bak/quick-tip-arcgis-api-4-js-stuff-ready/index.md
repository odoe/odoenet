When working with the [ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), the occasion may come up when you ask yourself, _Is my layer ready for me to use yet?_

This question popped on a recent email chain of mine recently, and I realized that there are handful of ways you could answer this question depending on what your intention is.

So I put together this video to help you explore those very methods.

I'll give you some hints...

- [MapView#updating](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-MapView.html#updating)
- [LayerView#updating](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-layers-FeatureLayerView.html#updating)

Now go watch the video to learn more!
